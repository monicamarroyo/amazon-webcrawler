# I'll Be There - A Simple Social Network

## Purpose

This challenge is designed to test your ability to design, build, and deploy a simple web application.  Clean software design, efficient implementation, and setting up a reliable deployment process will all be considered when evaluating your submision.

The problem itself is not arbritary but meant to simulate the type of work you would be doing here at Datafiniti.

Have fun, be creative and ask questions! 

## Problem Description

Your challenge is to build a simple social network with basic functionality.  At a minimum, users should be able to perform the following functions:

* Register for an account
* Login to the application
* Post a status update
* Become friends with another person (establish a two-way connection)

We want to leave most of the design decisions up to you, as we like to see how candidates approach each of these features from a high-level.  We do not expect you to make a fully-featured application, so it's ok to leave out certain functionality (e.g., form validation).  You may approach the challenge as you would building an alpha, pre-MVP version of a product.  It will work, but there are surely ways to improve it.

To begin, fork this repository to your personal Github account.

## Submission Requirements

* Any language is fine.
* You may use any third party libraries you wish. Be prepared to explain your choices.
* You must deploy your application on a website we can access (either publicly-available or via a login you share with us).

Please submit your code and a link to the website within 2 weeks.  If this too short of a turnaround time, please let us know.

## What We'll Be Looking For

* Code readability and reusability (how "productized" your code is)
* Practical and sensible use of third-party code
